Most modules in here come from pycrypto 2.6. I've separated out only
the parts needed for TLS to simplify porting to other platforms, and
to eliminate dependencies on GPL code.

The only change I made here is in hash_template.c, block_template.c,
and stream_template.c, where I removed "Crypto.Hash." from the module
names.
